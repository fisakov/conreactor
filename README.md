# Constraints Reactor

An engine for evaluating constraint rules. 

Written in Kotlin and Java.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fisakov/conreactor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fisakov/conreactor)

This is an implementation of the [Constraint Handling Rules](http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/pm/fileadmin/pm/home/fruehwirth/constraint-handling-rules-book.html) semantics with custom extensions, influenced by [JCHR](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CHR/JCHR/). 

The main features are built-in support for **terms** as the data structure, including terms **unification**, and **logical variables**.

The use of termsÂ as constraint parameters enables to implement optimizations for handling multi-head rules. Also, this implementation relies heavily on term unification when matching rules.
   
Logical variables enable to pass parameters to constraints as indirect references, which may be assigned later. Assigning a value to an unbound logical variable reactivates the constraint in which it serves as a parameter. Two logical variables may be joined to be treated as one.    

NOTE: this implementation does not include support for parsing the CHR syntax.
